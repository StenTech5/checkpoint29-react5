Debugging Process
Issue 1: Prop Validation in Greeting

Problem: The Greeting component lacked validation for the name prop.
Fix: Added PropTypes validation to ensure name is a required string.
Issue 2: Prevent Negative Values in Counter

Problem: The counter could decrement to negative values.
Fix: Updated the decrement function to prevent the count from going below zero.
Verification:

Used React Developer Tools to inspect state and props.
Tested user interactions to confirm the fixes.
